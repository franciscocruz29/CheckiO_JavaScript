/* You have a list of family ties between father and son. Each element on this list has two elements. 
The first is the father's name, the second is the son's name. 
All names in the family are unique. Check if the family tree is correct. 
There are no strangers in the family tree. All connections in the family are natural.

Input: An array of arrays. Each element has two strings. The array has at least one element

Output: Bool. Is the family tree correct. 

Example:

isFamily([["Logan", "Mike"]]) => true

isFamily([
        ["Logan", "Mike"],
        ["Logan", "Jack"],
        ["Mike", "Alexander"],
    ]) => true

isFamily([
        ["Logan", "Mike"],
        ["Logan", "Jack"],
        ["Mike", "Logan"],
    ]) => false

Precondition: 1 <= len(tree) < 100

/* Understanding the problem:

Rules:
* The father that isnâ€™t also a son is the root of the tree
* Each son should have exactly one father
* There is only one root of the tree
* A father can't be a son of any of his children down the line
